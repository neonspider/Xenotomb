This is the dev github. If you feel like checking us out, please be discrete. We'll announce the project when WE feel ready.
Until then you'll see lots of place holders, lots of broken stuff, and generally just spam commits.

If you do decide to check it out here's some basic game related info

The map structure is aXX, bXX, cXX for each significant environment change.
a = Initial environment
b = "outside" vacuum environment. Oxygen system isn't implemented yet so feel free to float about like a sponge.
c = [tbd]
d = planet/moon environment. Normal gravity, probably won't be vacuum.

s = possible wave survival maps. No connection between maps, just different numbers for different survival arenas.

Textures will be typical Doom resolutions, although we're using cubemap skyboxes and GL specific features.
Files will typically be .png or native doom lump, no exceptions.
We're trying to comprimise between having a legitimate loading screen and not so we can have some cool loading music.

AMost custom assets until dedicated devs are brought in are likely by Neo Te-Aika (music and sounds 100% will be.)

again, this will show up on forums soon, when it's ready. I'm not gonna announce just an idea with nothing competent to show.

BTW, we're the guys that made Crater and it's MIDI, Killing Floor. (Map12 of DUMP 3).
